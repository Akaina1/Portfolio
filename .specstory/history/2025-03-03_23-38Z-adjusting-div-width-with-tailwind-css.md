# Adjusting Div Width with Tailwind CSS (2025-03-03 23:38Z)

_**User (2025-03-03 23:39Z)**_

I need this return div to strech the width of the screen with a bit of margin on the edges

Looking at your request, you need to modify the container div in your CharacterSelection component to stretch across the screen width with some margin on the edges. Let me help you with that using Tailwind CSS.

```tsx:src/components/Game/CharacterSelection/index.tsx
// ... existing code ...
return (
  <div className="w-[calc(100vw-2rem)] mx-auto my-4 p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
    {/* ... existing code ... */}
  </div>
);
// ... existing code ...
```

This change uses Tailwind CSS to:

1. Set the width to `w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` which makes the container take up the full viewport width minus 2rem (32px) total
2. Add `mx-auto` to center the container horizontally with equal margins on both sides
3. Keep your existing padding and styling (assuming you had some)

If you need more or less margin, you can adjust the calculation. For example:
- For smaller margins: `w-[calc(100vw-1rem)]`
- For larger margins: `w-[calc(100vw-4rem)]`

Alternatively, if you prefer a simpler approach with percentage-based width:

```tsx:src/components/Game/CharacterSelection/index.tsx
// ... existing code ...
return (
  <div className="w-[95%] mx-auto my-4 p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
    {/* ... existing code ... */}
  </div>
);
// ... existing code ...
```

This would give you a container that's 95% of the viewport width with auto margins on the sides.
